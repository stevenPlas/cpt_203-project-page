					How do you balance work, life and school? This is a great question, and it is something that I  <br>
					strive to achieve every single day. Is it easy? No. Is it possible? Yes, it is possible, but it is not an easy accomplishment.  <br>
					Over the years, I have tried everything from completely focusing on one thing, then switch to another, to balancing everything at the same time.  <br>
					What has worked for me? I think I need to do some explaining about myself first,  <br>
					then we will go into how to balance your life, for the better.<br>
					<br><br>
					I work full time, I am a full time student, and I have a full time girlfriend, on top of all of my friends.  
					When it comes to balancing these, it is a hard feat to accomplish. For starters, working full time means that I have to be at my place of work 40 hours a week,<br>  
					No if’s and’s or but’s about it. When you figure out the math, there is 168 hours in a week, 168-40 = 128. So after work I have a total, of 128 hours for <br> 
					everything left over. For school, I spend a total of 8 hours a week, just in class, and that takes that 128 hours down to 120. That is just the time IN class,<br> 
					not actual homework.  When you figure out the homework, I spend about 30 hours a week on homework, so that knocks that 120 down to 90 hours a week. After that,<br> 
					you have to figure in the amount of sleep you get. I manage to sleep about seven hours and thirty minutes a night, from 11:00pm, to 6:30am. That calculates<br>
					out to 52.5 hours of sleep per week. Now I am down to  37.5 hours of my life, and then there is the commute! When you figure out that I spend 30 minutes <br>
					traveling one way to school, it adds up to three more hours of just driving to school! Now I’m left with 34.5 hours for the rest of my week.<br>
					I am not counting in the commute to my place of work, because it is about a mile away from where I live, so a minute here or there doesn’t matter too much in this area.
					<br><br>
					Let’s talk about how to balance all of this. First, you need to figure out how much time you spend on everything.  <br>
					Much like I have in the last portion of this post, and then you need to figure out how to make it work for YOUR life. Everyone’s life is different, I work a <br>
					different shift, and go to school at a different time than what someone else will. So this will be different for each and every person,  <br>
					but it is something that will work, no matter who you are, or what you do, or how busy you are.
					<br><br>
					“Balance” What do you mean by balance? I mean exactly what it says. You must balance your life, according to your life. But don’t over-do it.<br>  
					The strongest tool that anyone has in their pocket at all times, is their cell phone. You can do multiple things with your cell phone, but there is <br>
					one thing that people don’t use it for, and that is a schedule, or daily planner, a notepad, anything that lets you keep track, and write things down. <br>
					You want to use that to your advantage, use reminders, use everything at your disposal, in order to keep track of your life, and balance it. 
					<br><br>
					You want to sit down, and figure out what all you have to accomplish for the week, and figure out how many hours a day you will need to spend on it <br>
					in order to  accomplish said goal. Now you may be wondering, “Why do a little bit daily, instead of all at once?” Because you will burn out. <br>
					If you don’t separate things, and use up that last  34.5 hours a little each day, then you will go insane. <br>
					You will break. Everything will slowly come crashing down, because when you do too much work, and not any fun time at all, then you begin to slowly, <br>
					but surly, hate your life, all because you’re not having any fun. If you do not spread out your work, and spend a little time doing what you want,<br>
					or with people you love and care about, then you are going to drive yourself crazy. 
					<br><br>
					It is without a doubt in my mind that this method works, it is the only reason that I have come as far as I have.<br>  
					It may have taken me a while to learn this, but it works. Just keep a daily schedule of what needs done, and make some free time for yourself.  <br>
					It is the only way to live, when you are so busy with life.<br>
